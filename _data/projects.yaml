  - title: "SBSPO : Self-Bootstrapping Mitigates Object Hallucination via Preference Optimization"
    authors: "Proposed a Self-BootStrapping Preference Optimization algorithm. SBSPO leverages the full potential of open-source MLLMs from two key perspectives: (1) as a policy model within a reinforcement learning framework, and (2) as an implicit reward model that facilitates the generation of high-quality feedback data for preference learning"

  - title: "Watch And Learn: Empowering MLLMs to Count Like Humans"
    authors: "We propose the Watch-and-Learn framework, which enables continuous visual perception during counting by integrating two function calls, “Point Annotation” and “See Image.” This approach allows the model to iteratively process visual information, improving its reasoning ability."

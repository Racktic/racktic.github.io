## About Me

I am currently an undergraduate student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), beginning in the Fall of 2023. I am pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Statistics.

In the summer of 2024, I joined [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Professor [Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/).

I am always open to collaboration and discussions, whether with senior researchers or fellow peers. Please feel free to reach out!

## Research Interests

My research goal is to develop **Multi-Modal models** that exhibit **human-like understanding**, with the ultimate aim of leveraging these models to achieve **general decision-making intelligence**. 

Currently, my research interests include:

- **Multi-Modal Learning:**  Multi-Modal Reasoning (e.g. Tool-use, Self-reflection)
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Efficient and Scalable RL algorithms for MLLM and LLM

## News

- **[June. 2025]** I led my team to get **No.3** out of 400+ teams at a Baidu Inc. Data Mining Competition.
- **[May. 2025]** I finished the first phase of **Sparking Program**, the most prestigious and selective academic organization for students at Tsinghua University.
- **[Jan. 2025]** **RLAIF-V** is accepted by *CVPR 2025*, and selected as Highlight!
- **[Nov. 2024]** Honored to receive Comprehensive Excellence Award of Tsinghua.
- **[Nov. 2024]** Glad to receive Outstanding Sports Scholarship of Tsinghua.
